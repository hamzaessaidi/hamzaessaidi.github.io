## Inventor's Inequality Aversion [Job Market Paper] [[Draft]](files/)
### Abstract: 
The consequences of income inequality extend beyond social and moral considerations, with
tangible economic implications for the long-term performance of companies. This paper examines the
causal impact of within-firm inequality on corporate innovation, exploiting the staggered implemen-
tation of the SECâ€™s pay ratio disclosure rule. I find that firms disclosing high pay ratios experience a
significant decline in innovation output, driven primarily by increased inventor mobility and decreased
productivity, particularly among women, minority, and younger inventors.

## The National Flood Insurance Program, Racial and Ethnic Disparity, and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice [[Draft]](files/)
### Winner of the 2023 Hagen Award at the ARIA Annual Meeting
### Abstract: 
Using a combined dataset of nationwide flood insurance policies and claims, we find that
minorities tend to pay higher premium, obtain less coverage per premium dollar, and have a lower
likelihood of getting claims paid, which could explain lower take-up rates. Our results add to the
discussions on discrimination by institutions and have significant public policy implications.

## The Demographics of Property Insurance: Evidence from the Homeowners Insurance Market
### Abstract: 
We provide evidence that there is a disparate impact on minorities of the availability of
private market property insurance in Florida. Using spatial analysis, we show that demographic factors
explain reduced private market penetration, even after controlling for risk exposure.
