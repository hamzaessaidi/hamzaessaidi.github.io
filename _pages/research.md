### Inventor's Inequality Aversion [Job Market Paper] 



*Abstract:* 

> The consequences of income inequality extend beyond social and moral considerations, with tangible economic implications for the long-term performance of companies. This paper examines the causal impact of within-firm inequality on corporate innovation, exploiting the staggered implementation of the SEC’s pay ratio disclosure rule. I find that firms disclosing high pay ratios experience a significant decline in innovation output, driven primarily by increased inventor mobility and decreased productivity, particularly among women, minority, and younger inventors.

### The National Flood Insurance Program, Racial and Ethnic Disparity, and the Pursuit of Environmental Justice


*Winner of the 2023 Hagen Award at the ARIA Annual Meeting*

*Abstract:* 

> Using a combined dataset of nationwide flood insurance policies and claims, we find that minorities tend to pay higher premium, obtain less coverage per premium dollar, and have a lower likelihood of getting claims paid, which could explain lower take-up rates. Our results add to the discussions on discrimination by institutions and have significant public policy implications.

### The Demographics of Property Insurance: Evidence from the Homeowners Insurance Market

*Abstract:*

> We provide evidence that there is a disparate impact on minorities of the availability of private market property insurance in Florida. Using spatial analysis, we show that demographic factors explain reduced private market penetration, even after controlling for risk exposure.

### On the Resilience of Managerial Overconfidence
*Abstract:*

> I examine whether managers’ optimism and over-precision about their ability to adapt when faced with sudden distress, using increased exposure to hurricanes as a proxy. I investigate whether they exhibit greater resilience and, if so, the psychological mechanisms behind it. My findings reveal that risk-taking behavior is the primary driver behind these observations, with only moderate levels of overconfidence exhibiting resilience, suggesting that excessive overconfidence may lead to detrimental risk-taking.
